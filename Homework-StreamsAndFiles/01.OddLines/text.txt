 The compression functionality in DeflateStream and
 GZipStream is exposed as a stream. Data is read on a
 byte-by-byte basis, so it is not possible to perform
 multiple passes to determine the best method for
 compressing entire files or large blocks of data.
 The DeflateStream and GZipStream classes are best used
 on uncompressed sources of data. If the source data is
 already compressed, using these classes may actually 
increase the size of the stream.
